Hi, I’m Albert Einstein, a theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, I have always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. My journey in science began at a young age, and over the years, I have made significant contributions to modern physics.

One of my most famous equations is (E = mc^2), which shows the relationship between mass and energy. This discovery has had a profound impact on the field of physics and beyond. In 1921, I was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics for my explanation of the photoelectric effect, which further cemented my place in scientific history.

Throughout my career, I have worked on various theories and concepts that have shaped our understanding of the universe. I spent my later years in the United States, where I continued to explore theoretical physics and advocate for civil rights and pacifism.

When I’m not immersed in scientific research, I enjoy playing the violin and sailing. My passion for knowledge and discovery drives me to keep questioning and exploring the world around us.
